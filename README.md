## About The Project

Socrates (469â€“399 BC) spent most of his life dialoguing with people in the streets and public squares of the city. *Trees won't teach me anything*, he once said. He and his conversation partners explored subjects through a process of **Question** and **Answer**; a technique now known as **Socratic Method**.

In another moment, upon seeing a vast array of goods for sale, Socrates remarked, *How many things I can do without!*.

STM32F4 Socrates Project applies this Socratic approach to implement a **Command Processor** for the STM32F4 family. It follows the principles of the Socratic Method within a simplified environment using a minimal set of tools.
